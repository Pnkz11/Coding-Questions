What is data structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently.


WHY DATA STRUCTURE?

1. There are essential ingredients in crearting fast and powerful algorithms.
2. They help manage and organize data.
3. They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

Abstract data types vs data structure

An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a fata structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language. 


Example: 

Abstraction(ADT)  : Implemetation(Data structure)

List :  Dynamic Array , 
		Linked List

Queue : Linked list based Queue,
		Array based Queue,
		Stack based Queue

Map : Tree Map
	  Hash map/Hash Table

Complexity Analysis: 

Big-O-Notation: gives the an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case,
				helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large. 


n ==> size of the input

Complexities ordered in from smallest to largest:

Constant 		Time : O(1)
Logarthimic 	Time : O(log(n))
Linear 			Time : O(n)
Linearithimtic  Time : O(nlogn)
Quadric			Time : O(n^2)
Cubic			Time : O(n^3)
Exponential 	Time : O(b^n) , b > 1
Factorial   	Time : O(n!)l
