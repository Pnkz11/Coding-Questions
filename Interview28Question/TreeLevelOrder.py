'''
Given a binary tree of integers, print it in level order. 
The output will contain space between the numbers in the same level, 
and new line between different levels.
Input:  1
	   / \
	  2   3
	 /   / \
	4   5   6

Output:
1
2 3
4 5 6

breadth first search => weâ€™ll push the root node into the queue. 
Then we start a while loop with the condition queue not being empty. 
Time complexity of this solution is O(N), 
which is the number of nodes in the tree
